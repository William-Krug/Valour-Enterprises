# Valour Enterprises

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This mock website was created in attempt to learn more about the front end of software development. After creating, and submitting, a resume HTML page for admission to [Prime Digital Academy](www.primeacademy.io) I found myself woefully lacking in front end abilities. To start learning more, I created a mock up of a website for a holding company and its subsidiaries that, I think, would be fun to own one day. This site was built with straight HTML and vanilla CSS as a stepping stone and learning experience.
