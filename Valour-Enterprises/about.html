         <h2>About</h2>
         <br>
         <p>
            <span class="firstLetter">I</span>t started as an ideal in Raleigh,
            NC.  William Krug, CEO of Valour Enterprises was training in
            medieval combat and the virtues of knighthood resonated deeply and
            passionately within his bones.  William kept those ideals in the
            back of his head as he progressed through life.  Every time a new
            situation occured, William assed the pros and cons, wondering what
            he liked, what he didn't, and how it could be made better.  One fall
            morning, an oppurtutity presented itself and William jumped head
            first into it and hasn't looked back.
            <br><br>
            Today, Valour Enterprises companies lead their respective industries
            in customer satisfaction.  The thought that a happy employee
            provides better customer service drives all aspects of the company
            culture.  Monthly cookouts, company sponsored teams, relaxed
            atomsphere, and engaging work projects have all led to increased
            employee moral.  These happy individuals love what they do and have
            banded together to form the strongest, most capable team in the area.
